How do we commit our excel sheet in azure git repos
using source control
i understand from yesterday's task that the manual task between source org to target org that we can perform by export and import the files into csv format but some things (like minor changes) can not be migrated that we need to do it manually on the org. 
we need to store these manual steps in a csv file and to store in a git repo using flex deploy or directly to the git.

salesforce change sets for small deployments and its a in built tool that lets you to move between connected orgs.(sandbox to production)
the change sets is used for a one time manual migration if both orgs are linked.
Helooo

some changes cannot be moved or deployed via deployment tools, u will have manually replicate them all to the target org.
Like access settings & security , reports & dashboards, integration and connected apps.

2 ways we can add a csv files to the repository 

1. directly adding the csv file into git repo with drag and drop or using push command
2. uploading csv file into the repository using flex deploy.
  projects--> select the project you wanted to upload the csv file--> execution tab--> click on any recent execution--> aritifacts tab will be available---> click on that---> there must be an option in the artifacts tab to upload csv file. blocking here
  we can also create a workflow to upload a csv file. create workflow with utility type then only the shell script will be available under workflow operation it is not available. blocking here.
utility type is generating and storing csv files, database operations, code scanning, custom scripts for automation.
  we can also create a dynamically create a csv file. But shell script option is not available.
  need to check!!

 to upload the file in repository
and add some changes into the file and merge the changes one branch into another branch. 
once that is done try to squash those commits together.
